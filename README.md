# cineMOOD

### About
cineMOOD is a web platform that uses machine learning to recommend movies to users based on text input as well as their previously watched movies and reviews. 

Inspired by the website GoodReads, we decided to create a similar website for movies instead. Apart from the movie recommender feature above, our website allows users to browse for movies and add them to their watchlist and watch history. Reviews can also be written under movies to facilitate discussions.

To learn more about this web app, refer to the linked README below which has around 100 pages on our nine features, testing processes and software engineering practices.
