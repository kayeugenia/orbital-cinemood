### Motivation 
Have you ever had a hard time deciding what movies to watch on streaming services? With an overwhelming number of options available, itâ€™s common to spend hours scrolling through the movie section without finding anything that suits your tastes and end up rewatching your favourite movies. While some streaming services offer movie recommendations based on genres, these suggestions are often impersonal and fail to take into account our unique preferences and mood. Moreover, their suggested movies are limited to the movies available on their platform, further restricting our options. 

But what if we could use our watch history and current mood to find the perfect movie for our next viewing experience? 

### Aim 
We hope to help users decide on what movies to watch by creating a web platform that uses machine learning to recommend movies to users based on text input as well as their previously watched movies and reviews.

### User Stories
As a user who is looking for movies to watch, I can simply input the type of movie I am interested in and the website would fetch movie recommendations

As a user who is looking for movies to watch, I can sort and filter recommended movies based on a range of metrics, including user ratings, as well as their favourite actresses and actors

As a user looking for a specific movie, I can type the movie name and obtain details on the movie and look at user reviews

As a movie enthusiast, I can record past movies I have watched as well as my ratings/ review of the movie on my profile
